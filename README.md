# AutoML-Automated-Machine-Learning

Automated machine learning is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model.

## What is Automated Machine Learning?

Automated machine learning (AutoML) represents a fundamental shift in the way organizations of all sizes approach machine learning and data science. Applying traditional machine learning methods to real-world business problems is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and challenging.

> Automated machine learning changes that, making it easier to build and use machine learning models in the real world by running systematic processes on raw data and selecting models that pull the most relevant information from the data – what is often referred to as “the signal in the noise.” Automated machine learning incorporates machine learning best practices from top-ranked data scientists to make data science more accessible across the organization.
